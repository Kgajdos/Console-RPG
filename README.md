# Console-RPG
Actual Project
STILL NEEDS: 
Need a combat function (health modification has been set, but logic is not finished)!
Need an enemy class (rat) to fight the player
Need to work out a character sheet
Figure out how to work the sword class and how it gets equiped by the player
Need a wallet system!
Need to figure out how to modify stats in a class after those have been initially set
(this is a big pain right now...)
